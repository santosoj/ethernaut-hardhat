        <p>The solver’s <code>whatIsTheMeaningOfLife</code> function just needs to return 42,
but it needs to do it in at most 10 bytes of code. Becaose Solidity adds
too much boilerplate, we need to create the bytecode in a different way.</p>
<p>At a size of 10 bytes, it wouldn’t be too hard to handwrite the bytecode
with the help of an opcode table, as the level description suggests. However,
there’s a more comfortable way: the tools that come with <em>geth</em> include
<em>evm</em> which may be used as an EVM assembler.</p>
<p>We’ll write a contract that doesn’t do anything except return the number 42.
Note that since the contract doesn’t look at the call data at all, it does
the same regardless of what call data is sent: it doesn’t need to be the
function signature of <code>whatIsTheMeaningOfLife</code>.</p>

        <div class='highlight'><pre><span class="hljs-comment">/*
push 42
push 0
mstore
push 32
push 0
return
*/</span></pre></div>
      
        
        <p>That’s all we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the value 42 at memory address 0.</li>
<li>Return 32 bytes beginning from memory address 0. (<code>mstore</code> stores a 256-bit word.)
Putting above code in a file and processing it with <code>evm compile</code> yields the following
bytecode:</li>
</ul>

        <div class='highlight'><pre><span class="hljs-comment">/*
602a60005260206000f3
*/</span></pre></div>
      
        
        <p>It’s ten bytes long: just the size we need. But in order to deploy it as a
contract, we need to wrap it in a deployment bytecode. The deployment bytecode
is the code which, when executed by the EVM, returns our contract’s bytecode.
Again, an <code>mstore</code> followed by <code>return</code> will do the job. Note that we specify
a start address of <code>0x16</code> for <code>return</code>, since our contract occupies only the
last 10 bytes of the 256-bit word at memory address 0.</p>

        <div class='highlight'><pre><span class="hljs-comment">/*
push 0x602a60005260206000f3
push 0
mstore
push 10
push 0x16
return
*/</span></pre></div>
      
        
        <p>This yields the deployment bytecode:</p>

        <div class='highlight'><pre><span class="hljs-comment">/*
69602a60005260206000f3600052600a6016f3
*/</span></pre></div>
      
        
        <p>Sending a transaction with the deployment bytecode in the <code>data</code> field, and
without a <code>to</code> field, creates the new contract on the blockchain. The new
contract’s address is calculated from the sender’s address and  transaction nonce
(which is identical with the count of transactions the sender has sent).
<code>ethers.js</code> puts it in the <code>creates</code> field of the <code>TransactionResponse</code> for
a transaction that creates a contract.</p>
